This project is based on the work done by Edward Kmett and Paul Wilson on the [aeson-lens](https://github.com/lens/lens-aeson) package.

You can watch contributors carry on the quest for bragging rights in the [contributors graph](https://github.com/analytics/compensated/graphs/contributors).

Omission from this list is by no means an attempt to discount your contribution.

Thank you for all of your help!
